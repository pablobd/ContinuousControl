Train a DRL agent control a double-jointed arm, to reach target locations. Watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVIxt2rt1_4) to see how some researchers were able to train a similar task on a real robot! The accompanying research paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07067.pdf).

In the second version of the project environment, there are 20 identical copies of the agent. It has been shown that having multiple copies of the same agent sharing experience can accelerate learning, as explained in this [google AI blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/10/how-robots-can-acquire-new-skills-from.html).
